        How to play Sudoku
       
            The goal of Sudoku is to fill in a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3×3 section contain
            the numbers between 1 to 9. At the beginning of the game, the 9×9 grid will have some of the squares filled
            in. Your job is to use logic to fill in the missing digits and complete the grid. Don’t forget, a move is
            incorrect if:
        
       
             Any row contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
             Any column contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
             Any 3×3 grid contains more than one of the same number from 1 to 9
